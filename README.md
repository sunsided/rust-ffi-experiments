# Rust FFI Example

An experiment for learning Rust's FFI. Some pointers:

- [Calling `libc`'s `puts` from Rust](call-c-from-rust)
- [Calling a Rust function from C](call-rust-from-c)
- [Sending a Rust slice to a C function](send-array-to-c)
- [Sending a C array to a Rust function](send-array-to-rust)
- [Passing POD (Plain Old Data) types from C to Rust](send-pod-to-rust)
- [Passing complex types from Rust to C through opaque pointers](opaque-pointers-in-c) (with a Valgrind example)
